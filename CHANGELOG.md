## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added `/ea-registry` skill for org-level application/interface/domain registry operations (QUERY, CONTRIBUTE, AUDIT, FEED).
  - Added in `b8a20a0`.
- Added context-driven EA registry source-of-truth fields in profiles:
  - `architecture.ea_registry_repo`
  - `architecture.ea_registry_local_path`
  - `architecture.ea_registry_authoritative`
  - Added in `6c4e250`.
- Added four pipeline evolution skills:
  - `/loop-design`
  - `/token-optimization`
  - `/org-mapping`
  - `/scale-pipeline`
  - Added in `c9396f2`.
- Added four new templates:
  - `.github/templates/loop-design.md`
  - `.github/templates/token-optimization.md`
  - `.github/templates/org-mapping.md`
  - `.github/templates/scale-pipeline.md`
  - Added in `c9396f2`.

### Changed
- Refactored pipeline behavior to a hybrid model:
  - Keep strategic skills discrete (`/loop-design`, `/scale-pipeline`).
  - Embed token optimization and org-mapping policy overlays into core execution/review/release skills.
  - Implemented in `514e8ab`.
- Made release generation context-driven using `.github/context.yml` tool and governance fields.
  - Implemented in `d92b4cb`.
- Added explicit active-context mechanism and profile strategy (`.github/context.yml` + `.github/contexts/*`).
  - Implemented in `7cccf81`, `a817c38`.

### Fixed
- Removed hardcoded toolchain and environment assumptions across skills for portability.
  - Implemented across `3d7e508`, `7cccf81`, `a817c38`.
- Updated docs for context-based configuration and live `testPlan.passing` visualizer progress behavior.
  - Implemented in `7bdb8b0`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-20

### Initial tracked release notes baseline
- Bootstrapped and hardened the SDLC skill pipeline with structured artefacts, templates, and workflow/state conventions.
- Added enterprise architecture registry integration and context-driven portability model.
- Added pipeline evolution capability (loops, token optimization, org mapping, scale) and moved to hybrid embedded policy behavior in core skills.
